                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Zippy's Slime started in 2018 when our founder, Zoe "Zippy" Patterson, was experimenting with homemade slime recipes in her kitchen. What began as a fun hobby quickly turned into a passion for creating the perfect slime texture.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We believe in the power of slime to bring joy, relieve stress, and spark creativity. Our mission is to create high-quality, safe, and endlessly fun slime products that make people of all ages smile.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Process</h2>
                <p>Each batch of Zippy's Slime is handcrafted with care using premium ingredients. We test every texture for the perfect stretch, squish, and bubble-pop potential before it reaches you!</p>
